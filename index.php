	<h3><a href="teaching.html">Teaching</a></h3>
	<p>My teaching page contains a summary of my teaching experience, as well as links to my teaching-related publications (course notes, exercise lists). Given that this is also a historical archive, some of these are in Portuguese.</p>

	<h3><a href="personal.html">Personal</a></h3>
	<p>Lots of other stuff about me.  Among other things, I am a semi-professional singer and an expert on the history of the public transportation in Lisbon.</p>
