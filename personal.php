	<p>Welcome to my personal page!  If you're looking for anything university-related, this is the wrong place: for those things there's my <a href="index.html">official</a> page. Here you can surf through my other interests.
	</p>
	<p>For convenience, the information is split among different pages. Here I just include a short summary of what you can find in each of them.</p>

	<h3><a href="music.html">Music</a></h3>
	<p>I am a singer striving to do something serious with music in my life. This page gives a summary of what I've been doing, where I studied, choirs in which I have sung, and so on. Sometime in the future it will also be possible to download sheet music edited by me (of course, only when the actual music is no longer copyrighted).</p>

	<h3>Bus history (in portuguese)</h3>
	<p>A lot of my little spare time is dedicated to the buses (and trams) of Lisbon. I collect all sorts of stuff related to this, including old bus guides and timetables, photos of buses fighting their way through the chaotic Lisbon traffic and various amazing stuff (including, believe it or not, bus seats). <!--<a href="http://historiaccfl.webatu.com/">This page</a> includes most of the things that can be made available electronically, in particular, most of my bus guides have been scanned and are now available; as well as the largest database on the history of the Lisbon bus and tram routes from their origin.-->  My webpage on the topic is currently down, but planned to resurface in a not-so-distant future.</p>
	<p>As a complement to the archive, my now finished <a href="http://historiaccfl.blogspot.com/">blog</a> tells the same history in route-by-route analysis. I have also written a <!--<a href="http://historiaccfl.webatu.com/outros/livro.html">-->book<!--</a>--> on the history of the Lisbon tram lines.</p>
	<p>Due to their nature, these pages are in Portuguese. Feel free to browse through them and mail me any questions you might have.</p>

	<h3><a href="hate/ihatetoshiba.html">My Toshiba hate page</a></h3>
	<p>In 2003 I experienced a traumatizing experience with a Toshiba laptop that scarred me for life (metaphorically speaking).  Here you can read about why I do <span class="shout">not</span> recommend you buy any product from Toshiba.</p>
	<p>I should mention that my Toshiba Hate Page generated some half a dozen reactions from people who had very similar experiences in the year since it first went online. (Heed the warning.) On the other hand, it's been nearly twenty years, and this page is kept online mostly for historical reasons (and because it's cute).</p>

	<h3>Other stuff</h3>
	<p>I also have an amateur interest in languages. I understand, read, speak and write fluent English, not-so-fluent French (I read a lot, but where speaking is concerned I don't get the chance to practice much) and fluent-enough-for-my-needs Dutch (on which I passed an examination in July 2003) and Danish (similar examination in June 2015). I studied Latin for two years, but keep forgetting it. However, it does allow me to understand Spanish and Italian quite well, both written and spoken.</p>
